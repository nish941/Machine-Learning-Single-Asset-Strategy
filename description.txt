📈 Machine Learning-Based Single Asset Trading Strategy (Pfizer - PFE)
🔍 Overview
This project implements a machine learning-driven long/short trading strategy on Pfizer Inc. (PFE) stock using historical data from 2010-01-01 to 2025-04-16. The model predicts next-day returns and determines whether to take a $1M long or short position daily.

🛠️ Methodology
Data Extraction: Daily price and volume data for PFE stock using yfinance or equivalent APIs.

Feature Engineering:

Traditional: Returns, momentum, volatility, rolling statistics

Novel: Market sentiment, sector correlations, lagged technical indicators

Modeling Approach:

Predicts next-day return using historical features (no lookahead bias)

Models include Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest

Backtesting & Evaluation:

Strict train/validation/test splits (2022–2025 used as pure out-of-sample)

PnL computed using position × (today's close - previous close)

Metrics: Cumulative PnL, Sharpe Ratio, Hit Ratio, Drawdown

📊 Visualization
Interactive plots showing cumulative returns over time

Comparison against benchmark passive long-only strategy

⚠️ Constraints
No lookahead bias throughout data processing and modeling

All rolling features normalized to prevent forward leakage

Daily decisions made with only data available up to that day
